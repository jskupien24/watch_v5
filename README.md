# Wearable Dive Computer App (Working Title)
This is (will be) an application that runs on the Apple Watch’s
WatchOS (with a companion iOS app), that tells a SCUBA diver all the relevant health and environmental
information that may make dives safer and/or easier (such as depth, direction, heart
rate, remaining air, decompression stops, surface intervals, etc.).

## Background:
I have been SCUBA diving for many years, and I am currently getting my final
certifications to become a dive master. Dive computers allow for safety and simplicity
when diving, and they have quickly become a staple in almost every diver’s kit. The
problem is, there are many casual/recreational divers who would benefit the most from
safety reminders and real-time information, who can’t quite rationalize spending
upwards of a thousand dollars on a watch just to dive a few times a year. The new
Apple Watch Ultra, however, is rated to reach incredible depths underwater, possesses
all of the necessary sensors to track anything a dive computer can (and also one of the
most powerful wearable health tracking framework), features both precise and GPS
locators, and touchless gesture control (which would allow interactive features to be
used underwater)! Unfortunately, no such WatchOS dive computer software exists yet
(or at least without a subscription cost and terrible ratings from its users).

## Project Needs:
1. Build an intuitive and easy-to-use Apple Watch app that can help divers gather
necessary insights while diving.
2. Allow the app to track relevant external metrics like depth, direction, water
temperature, dive time, remaining dive time, etc.
3. Issue immediate safety warnings if a diver, for example, is ascending at a
dangerous rate
4. Allow users to view dives as a physical activity, and view their biometrics, similar to
other workout trackers native to the Apple Watch.

## Potential Technical Considerations:
1. Developing an app for Apple Watch Ultra, using Xcode and Swift to allow an on-
the-go front end for our users
2. Harness the power of all the new sensors/functions of the Apple Watch Ultra,
including depth sensors, GPS/compass capabilities, temperature sensors, deep
water capabilities, and time measurement (Since time under water and ascent rates
are the two most important features of a dive computer.
3. Merge with existing Apple Biometric sensors and data to allow divers to see their
heart rate, track physical exertion, and, most importantly, detect emergencies, such
as ascending too fast, running out of air, skewing from the original plan, etc.
4. Finally this app will be able to plan and log dives, (this is a part where it would be
really nice to Collaborate with the NAUI, since all of this is already done over there).
Planning and logging dives is extremely vital in the scuba community, and this
would allow for automation of the tricky/boring parts.

## Deliverables:
1. A functioning prototype (which we will be able to put to the test and demonstrate)
2. Team design, development, and implementation documentation
3. A verification of accurate results and proper functionality

## Assumptions and Dependencies:
\[TBD\]
